# C++ Chess Core & Bitboard Engine

A modern C++ chess engine project focused on low-level board state representation, bitboard attack generation, and Object-Oriented piece management. Built to sharpen C++ system programming and algorithmic problem-solving skills, with future goals of engine integration and visual UI rendering.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Bitboard Attack Generation:** Uses 64-bit integer (`uint64_t`) bitmasks and bitwise operations (`<<`, `>>`, `&`, `|`, `^`) to generate attack maps for Rooks, Bishops, Queens, Knights, Kings, and Pawns.
* **FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation) Parser:** Parses standard FEN strings into active game states (piece placement, active color, castling rights, en passant targets, halfmove clock, fullmove number).
* **Object-Oriented Architecture:** Base polymorphic `Piece` class leveraging `std::unique_ptr` dynamic dispatch alongside modern C++ features (`std::views::split`, `std::ranges::to`).
* **Bitwise State Encoding:** Encodes piece types and colors efficiently using 5-bit flags (e.g., `0b01000` for White, `0b10000` for Black, `0b001` for Pawn).

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Requirements

* **Language:** Modern C++ (C++20 / C++23)
* **Compiler:** MSVC (Visual Studio), GCC, or Clang supporting C++20 ranges and views
* **Dependencies:**
  * C++ Standard Library (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<bitset>`, `<memory>`, `<ranges>`)
  * Raylib *(configured for upcoming visual frontend)*

---

## 🚀 Building & Running

### Using MSVC / Visual Studio Code

1. Ensure a C++ compiler with C++20 support is available.
2. Compile and link the main entry point:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o chess_app
   ```

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Plans
* **Refactor #include** ".cpp" include chains into proper .hpp/.cpp header separations.

* **Complete CMake build configuration** across cross-platform compilers.

* **Finish move validation logic** (pin checks, legal check/checkmate detection).

* **Implement a full Raylib 2D GUI** for visual playability.

* **Develop a custom Chess AI/Bot** (Minimax search with Alpha-Beta pruning).

* **Explore engine migration/port** to C# with Unity/Godot for 2D/3D rendering.
